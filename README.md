# Mobile_Recommendation

In many cases we need to develop an individualized recommendation system for a subset of all items. When fulfilling such task, besides utilizing the 
user behavior data in such subset of items, we also need to utilize more comprehensive user behavior data.

You can download the dataset from[here]{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XxJWCuddArKad4hW98tYCKB4Sdcm_Sum?usp=sharing}. This dataset includes the behavior data of 20,000 users and the information of millions of items.

The training data contains the mobile behavior data of certain quantity of sampled users in one month (11.18~12.18) (D). The evaluation data is the purchase
data of these same users of the items in P one month later (12.19). The participants should develop a model to predict the purchase behavior of the users of 
the items in the next day.
